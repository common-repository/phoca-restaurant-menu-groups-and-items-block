Phoca Restaurant Menu Groups and Items Block is a Gutenberg plugin that works together with its parent block Phoca Restaurant Block


== Description ==

Phoca Restaurant Menu Groups and Items Block is a Gutenberg plugin that works together with its parent block <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/phoca-restaurant-menu-block" target="_blank">Phoca Restaurant Block</a>. This plugin allows users to create menus for various establishments, such as restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food joints, school canteens, buffets, bars, clubs, snack bars, winerooms, and more, directly within their WordPress articles.

With Phoca Restaurant Menu Groups and Items Block, you can easily organize and display daily menus for your restaurant or food establishment. Whether you need to showcase different dishes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or offer daily specials, this plugin simplifies the process, making it effortless to create and manage your menus.

Please note that there is an issue with the Gutenberg block feature: when blocks are duplicated, the data entered into the form fields of the duplicated block can overwrite the data in the source block. To work around this issue, you have two options:

1. Do not use the duplicate feature. Instead, use Copy function - create a new block and copy the content from the original block,
2. Or, after duplicating a block, save (update) the article and reload the site. This action will ensure that all form fields in the duplicated block remain independent of the source block.
